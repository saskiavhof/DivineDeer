    showPopup("Buddhism", "Todaiji Temple holds a central position within Nara Park, mirroring how Buddhism plays a pivotal role in the protection and history of the Nara deer. Although Shintoism predates Buddhism in Japan, the two traditions gradually became intertwined. The imported Buddhis traditions incorporated Native religious concepts, creating a distinct fusion. The two religions are practiced simultaneously even today, but the changes in the representation of Shinto deities throughout time shows the impact of Buddhist influence. The hanging scroll “Deer Mandala of Kasuga Shrine” depicts the Shinto story of Takemikazuchi on a deer underneath a reflection of five buddhist deities. This showed that by the fourteenth century, the fusion of Buddhism and Shinto led to the belief in Shinto ‘kami’ as manifestation of Buddhist deities. A notable distinction lies in the interpretation of the deer’s color, as the scroll with the Buddhist interpretation depict it as brown rather than white. While white, in Buddhism, is also associated with purity, it primarily symbolizes mourning (Saito). \n\n Deer hold significant symbolism in Buddhism, representing Buddha’s first teachings and the act of receiving them. The “Setting in Motion of the Wheel of the Dhamma Sutta” (or Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta) recounts Buddha's initial teachings in Deer Park, Sarnath, India. As Buddha addressed five skeptics, a doe and a stag emerged from the forest. They stood beside the dharma wheel, attentively listening to Buddha. The deer’s divine nature was reasserted by the monks of the Kofuku-ji Buddhist temple in Nara, who considered killing one to be a crime punishable by death. Thus, the reverence for the deer as sacred beings underscores the profound connection between Buddhism and the deer in Nara.");

Over eighty percent of the Japanese population follow Shinto rituals to some degree, which means that the Shinto depiction of animals holds significant cultural relevance. In Shinto beliefs, various animals are considered sacred or are tied to legends, such as foxes, koi fish, Japanese macaques, tanukis, and wild boars. Deer, in particular, are highly revered in Shintoism and are viewed as messengers of the gods in parts of the country, including Nara. In a Deer mandala from the 17th century the white deer stands atop a cloud. This cloud represents that the deer has transcended from heaven, as they are messengers of gods. In various parts of Northeast Japan, the Shinto interpretation of deer inspired a dance called “shishi-odori” in which people wear deer masks as an annual religious ritual.");

It was impossible to resist their pressing invitation, although there was nothing violent in their demonstration. They closed around me and waited patiently while I purchased a supply of their favorite refreshment, and fed them one after another by hand' (House).

Takemikazuchi, the Shinto god of thunder, swords, and sumo wrestling, was a prominent early deity. He was said to have been born when the god of creation severed the head of the fire deity with a sword, and the blood on the hilt of the sword gave life to Takemikazuchi. As his violent birth suggests, he is a deity of great physical strength, competing in the first sumo match in history. His strength goes beyond the capabilities of man, with a popular Edo print depicting Takemikazuchi fighting against a giant catfish that resided underneath the landmass of Japan and had been causing all of the country’s earthquakes.\n\nIn the 8th century, a legend emerged depicting Takemikazuchi riding into the city of Nara on a white deer, establishing the first Japanese Dynasty. This legend led to deer being revered as messengers of the gods in Nara. On the right is a 14th-century silk hanging scroll titled 'Departure from Kashima,' that depicts Takemikazuchi on a white deer (Nara National Museum). The juxtaposition of a physically powerful and masculine Takemikazuchi atop a white deer is especially significant, considering that the color white (as in many other religious cultures around the world) represents spiritual purity in Shintoism (Saito). The purity of this deer, an animal characterized as graceful and shy, is accentuated by being obedient to such a powerful depiction of a human deity. ");

Observations on these bowing behaviors found that the habit develops with age and is socially influenced. In the poem “Deer in Nara Park,” Laurence Lieberman narrates the gentleness and comfort that even the young fawns express when interacting with his children: “One fawn appears to pass, mirage-like, through my stooping son’s hips and shoulder–in my sideview, a figure crosshatched, composed of shimmering diamonds and spheroids of light” (Lieberman). The use of the word “mirage-like” to describe the fawn as something of an illusion is interesting, and it suggests that the fawn is behaving in a way that the author finds contradictory to nature. The deer in Nara park learn from a very young age not to be afraid of humans, creating a unique dynamic where the wild animals casually come close enough to go “through my stooping son’s hips and shoulder”(Lieberman).");

    showPopup("Impact of the Pause of Tourism Due to Covid-19", "Before the Covid outbreak, millions of tourists came to Nara to feed the estimated 1,300 free-romating deer, offering them their preferred snack of senbei rice crackers. However, many of these deer ate too many of them, triggering a raging thirst and subsequent over drinking, leading to gastrointestinal problems. Without the regular supply of senbei, the deers have been forced back into their native diet, resulting in a transformation of their health (The Guardian). This information raises questions about the ecological impact of the deer-feeding business on the deers themselves. While the cookies are made to be deer-friendly, the issues with overeating and thirst suggest that humans do not actually have a positive impact on the deer. Despite the assumption that the wild animals have grown accustomed to the steady supply of cookies and thus rely on them, the truth is that the sika deer in Nara Park are self-sufficient without human intervention.");
